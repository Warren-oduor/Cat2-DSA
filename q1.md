# BIG O NOTATION IN ALGORITHM ANALYSIS

Big O is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
It expresses how runtime or space requirements grow as input increases

## 1.Constant Time - O(1)
An algorithm runs in O(1) time if its execution time remains constant regardless of its input size.
### Example
int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {

return arr[0];

}

Accessing the first element takes the same amount of time no matter how large the array is.

## 2.Linear time - O(n)
Execution time grows linearly with input size
### Example
void printElements(int[] arr) {

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

System.out.println(arr[i]);
}

}

Each element is printed once, so execution time increases as the array size increases.

## 3.Quadratic time - O(n^2)
Execution time grows proportionally to the square of the input size.
### Example
void printPairs(int[] arr) {

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {

System.out.println(arr[i] + ", " + arr[j]);

}

}

}

We use two nested loops for this.

## 4.Logarithmic tome - O(log n)
the problem size is reduced by a fraction at each step
### Example
int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {

int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

while (left <= right) {

int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;

else if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;

else right = mid - 1;

}

return -1;

}

Binary search cuts the search space in half at each step, making it O(logn).

## 5.Factorial time - O(n!)
The runtime grows extremely fast as input size increases
### Example
void factorialRecursion(int n) {

if (n == 0) return;

factorialRecursion(n - 1);

}

### Conclusion
Big O notation helps in comparing different algorithms based on their efficiency. 
Understanding these rules allows developers to design better-performing applications.
