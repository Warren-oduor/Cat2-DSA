# Comparison Between Arrays and Linked Lists

## 1.Memory allocation
### Arrays
    -Uses contiguous memory allocation
    -Requires a fixed size,which may lead to wastage of memory
     if not fully utilized.
### Linked lists
    -Uses dynamic memory allocation, nodes are allocated as needed.
    -Each node contains an extra pointer to the next node,
     leading to higher memory usage.

## 2.Performance
### Arrays
    -Access time: O(1) for direct access using an index.
    -Search time: O(n) for an assorted array, O(log n) for a
     sorted array using binary search.
### Linked lists
    -Access time: O(n) since elements must be traversed sequentially.
    -Search time: O(n) since traversal is required.

## 3.Insertion and deletion operations
### Arrays
    -Insertion
        -O(1) if adding at the end
        -O(n) if inserting at the beginning or middle(requires shifting elements)
    -Deletion
        -O(1) if removing at the end
        -O(n) if removing at the beginning or middle(requires shifting elements)
### Linked lists
    -Insertion
        -O(1) if adding at the beginning
        -O(n) if inserting at a specific position(requires traversal)
    -Deletion
        -O(1) if adding at the beginning
        -O(n) if inserting at a specific position

### Conclusion
Arrays provide fast access but require contiguous memory, while linked lists offer flexibility in memory management 
but with extra overhead in traversal and memory usage. The choice depends on the use case.
